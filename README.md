# FraudDetection
Accounting errors are quite commonplace in businesses and government organizations. These can include errors occurring due to improper record keeping and data entry, missing data, irregular checks and balances or errors made in principle. These errors are sometimes easily rectifiable -- for example, by imputation of missing values and other standard statistical measures; but at other times, they can be costly leading to major financial penalties from non-compliance for the business or organization in question. 

Our goal in this research is to identify plausible accounting errors using sophisticated artificial intelligence / machine learning powered techniques. The identification and detection of such errors very early in the process can help prevent regulatory and other missteps down the road and are therefore very useful for the businesses in question. Our algorithm need real accounting data to train on; however, that dataset need not contain any personally identifiable or sensitive records. In order to ensure that the dataset is satisfactorily protected before we export that data into our programming environment, we suggest the following:
•	We will retain a research assistant (RA) with client approval to work on-site to ensure that the datasets are sufficiently anonymized.
•	This RA will use techniques such as data masking, swapping and perturbation to anonymize the datasets. These techniques will use a mixture of the following camouflage methods:
o	Shuffling of letters and numbers
o	Using fake identifiers
o	Outright removal of certain details (this would be similar to removing the house number from a street address)
o	Rounding numbers
o	Adding some random amount to numbers
o	Create artificial datasets that are share similar statistical features to the original dataset such as standard deviations, median, etc.
•	No dataset will be exported to our programming environment until the dataset is deemed to be appropriately masked by the client.
